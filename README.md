# DFA Minimization - TOA Project

A C++ implementation of Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) minimization using the partitioning method. This project demonstrates reducing DFA states while preserving language acceptance.

## Features
- Partition-based state minimization
- Color-coded output for initial, accepting, and non-accepting states
- Debug output for partition refinement
- Hardcoded sample DFA for testing

## File
- `main.cpp` â€” Contains the full implementation and a sample DFA
